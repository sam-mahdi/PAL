To run PAL [in linux]:

All you need to do is run the "run.sh" file in the terminal. 

```chmod +x run.sh``` [ONLY NEEDS TO BE DONE THE FIRST TIME YOU DOWNLOAD FROM GITHUB]

If you want to run TALOS or SPARTA+ via AVS, or map TALOS results on your PDB in AVS, run (do not run this command if you want to do literally anything else)

```./run.sh no_photo```

otherwise, just type in

```./run.sh```
